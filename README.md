### What is this app all about?

Jsonld Resume is a free and open source resume builder that‚Äôs built to make the mundane tasks of creating, updating and sharing your resume as easy as 1, 2, 3. With this app, you can create resumes that are read-able and index-able by all machine learning algorithms and systems easily and accurately, print as PDF (single-page or multi-page), all for free, no advertisements, without losing the integrity and privacy of your data.

You have complete control over what goes into your resume, how it looks, what colors, what templates, even the layout in which sections placed. Want a dark mode resume?

Everything you type, everything you change, appears immediately on your resume and gets updated in real time.

### Contribute

I try to do what I can, but if you found the app helpful, please consider contributing to it. Here is a list of TODOs:

1. Remove all json syntaxes and make the data structure totally json-ld. Currently resume data are on json-ld, but theme data are in json.

2. Build more fields to lverage the full power of json-ld. Right now, only a handful of fields are added to the resume, but we can have much more, like the sample json-ld resume you can find under skill repository.

3. Remove warnings. There are a few warnings by node.

4. There are some erros due to missing fields by google structral data testing tool. Those fields need to be added.

We modified the base code to accomodate for json-ld instead of original json format, and also added cool fatures that are only attainable with json-ld.
